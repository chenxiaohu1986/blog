# What is Markdown?
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

* [Gists](https://gist.github.com/)
* Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
* Files with the .md or .markdown extension

For more information, see “[Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/)” in the GitHub Help.

# Syntax guide

Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

## Headers

  ```
  # This is an <h1> tag
  ## This is an <h2> tag
  ###### This is an <h6> tag
  ```

## Emphasis

  ```
  *This text will be italic*
  _This will also be italic_

  **This text will be bold**
  __This will also be bold__

  _You **can** combine them_
  ```

## Lists
### Unordered
  ```
  * Item 1
  * Item 2
    * Item 2a
    * Item 2b
  ```

### Ordered

  ```
    1. Item 1
    1. Item 2
    1. Item 3
       1. Item 3a
       1. Item 3b
  ```

## Images
  ```
  ![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
  Format: ![Alt Text](url)
  ```

## Links
  ```
  http://github.com - automatic!
  [GitHub](http://github.com)
  ```

## Blockquotes
  ```
  As Kanye West said:

  > We're living the future so
  > the present is our past.
  ```

## Inline code
  ```
  I think you should use an
  `<addr>` element here instead.
  ```
